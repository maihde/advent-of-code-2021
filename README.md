Had a clever concept, but the syntax took awhile to understand, but the
resulting program was very consise.  It had very quick execution, but
it wasn't clear how much benefit this would provide in practical scenarios
where you could use Python/Perl instead.

Much humor!  The Haskell syntax is fun and it might be compelling to people who
already know Haskell but want to work with Python libraries or within a
existing Python system, but it doesn't provide any of Haskell's non-syntactial
benefits (static typing, purly functional, pattern matchiing).  So beyond the
cleverness, seems to not provide a specific value beyond just using Python.
